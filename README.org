# emacs-configs

This is a group of emacs configurations I have worked on from my
time. JMacs is my personal configuration, while writermacs is a
configuration that I believe will work well for writers.

** Goals of this Repo
   - To provide multiple emacs configurations for people to experiment with.
   - To help new users to Emacs become comfortable with the software,
     as well as to help me learn about organizing my config files.
** Installation
   To install a particular config, copy the particular folder you want
   to use to your ``` ~/.emacs.d/ ``` folder. On Linux, you would need
   to use the ``` -r ``` option.
