* emacs-configs

This is a group of emacs configurations I have worked on from my
time. JMacs is my personal configuration, while Writermacs is a
configuration that I believe will work well for writers. Macsworn is a
configuration specifically for playing [[https://www.ironswornrpg.com][Ironsworn]], and Minmacs is a minimalistic configuration of emacs, with Spacemacs keybindings.
** Goals of this Repo
   - To provide multiple emacs configurations for people to experiment with.
   - To help new users to Emacs become comfortable with the software, as well as to help me learn about organizing my config files.
** Installation
   To install a particular config, copy the particular folder you want
   to use to your "~/.emacs.d/" folder. On Linux, you would need to use the "-r" option.
